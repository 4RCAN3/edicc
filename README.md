Welcome to the MCU Fandom Character Chatbot project! This project enables you to fetch data from the fandom page of MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) characters and use that information to create interactive chatbots on Twitter. Users can create virtual characters based on MCU personalities and engage in conversations with them. Additionally, they can delete these characters when they are no longer needed.

## Overview

The MCU Fandom Character Chatbot (EDICC) is a unique project that combines data from MCU fandom with chatbot technology. Users can create and customize MCU characters as chatbots and have conversations with them on Twitter. This project serves as a fun and interactive way for MCU fans to explore their favorite characters in a new light.

## Features

- **Character Creation**: Users can create virtual chatbot characters based on MCU personalities. They can specify the character's name and their character's detail will be loaded by the model.

- **Fandom Data Integration**: The chatbots are equipped with information fetched from MCU fandom pages. This data can be used to make the chatbot's responses more accurate and true to the character.

- **Twitter Integration**: Chatbots can interact with users on Twitter, responding to mentions and messages from users who want to engage with their created characters.

- **Character Deletion**: When users are done with a character, they can delete it to free up resources and clean up their chatbot list.
